                        time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page:</h4>
                    <h4>Describing the content and layout for each page</h4>
                    <h4>Describing copyright and other constraints afecting websites</h4>

                <h4>This web site is composed by 4 page. The main one witch is home and the other 3. Each of that I use head, body, header, div, nav, section and footer like basic in HTML then after that is used CSS for style. In header you have the links
                    witch lead to another pages and header in on every page so you can easily go back and forth as you wish. In a section I put the background image nad text witch is just on main page, other one doesnt have it. You have short introduction
                    with text and pictures for visualization used by selection and div tag in HTML. Also on the front page I put button for email and subscribe created by tags section, div and form. At the bottom is footer witch si also important part
                    of the site and it’s on following pages as well. Footer is flexible so it depends how many text or images you have on page but he need to be always at the bottom of the page. Usually is text like "Copyright" but you can also see on
                    other pages in footer is email, location, contact etc. What ever you prefer. Every site need to contain copyright and of course depends witch content do you have. On the second page we have just text witch is simple so we ad list(li)
                    and h4 for size and order. The third one we also have just text so we used everything the same as previous page and for the last fourth as well we did same thing. If you notice the line between text you can put just tag hr and for
                    vizualization should be good. Now, lets go on CSS part where we can style and align nicely. To achieve that we used brackets like this {}, margin, padding, font-family, font-size, width, height, background, border, color, text-decoration,
                    display and float. Also, in front of container and button we put dot beacuse is div class. As there are many different file formats to choose from, we have selected the four best on the web: a JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF.
