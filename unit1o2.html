                    <h4>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h4>
                    <h4>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,Trello</h4>
                    <h4>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4>
                    <h4>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h4>
                    <h4>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h4>

                    <h4>In order to create this website we used Visual Studio Code. The sites we used like w3schools, stackoverflow and developer mozilla was very helpfull. You can learn and create so many things but you need a lot of practice. My personal
                        opinion about this website is I think is so far so good, but always can be better. For now it would not change anything al tho next time when I will create another project like this I will add more pictures maybe some video or
                        GIF and yes, the cookies. They are necessary part of website
                    </h4>
                    <p>Looking at my finished website I am very happy I have created this for my first website, although if I had more time or more knowledge on HTML and CSS I would add in animations and a portfolio of some of my photos that I've taken to
                        show off my interests more. I would also like to add hover affects so maybe I could add this to a future website I want to build for the future. But for my very first web site I am happy.</p>

                    <p>When looking at my website I have proof read my written work to see if I am answering all questions correctly. I also clicked all of my links to see if they take me to all the pages they should do, as well as checking if colours, images
                        etc are all working correctly. That way I know that all of my tasks meet the criteria and are fit for purpose.
