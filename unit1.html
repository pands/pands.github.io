                <h4>
                    The way we approach business is changing. As we continually pivot to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology, individual departments within an organization are becoming as agile as the larger companies themselves. IT departments are experiencing tremendous
                    changes as their roles expand to impact customer service, sales, and even business strategies. As a result, organizations are increasingly turning IT into a driving force in all aspects of business. Become Leaders, Not Supporters One
                    thing to understand when managing the growing pains of IT is that it’s no longer the work of a single department. Research from Accenture found that 34% of companies see the IT department as the main driver of innovation, which is
                    down from 71% two years ago.
                    <p> I see the reason for this as a change in IT infrastructure itself. The modern IT worker is a tech-savvy innovator who creates change across the organization’s entirety, not just a single department. As employees create change across
                        all levels of an organization, the new face of IT defies boundaries. uncaptioned Gallery: 5 IT Jobs That Saw A Salary Boost 6 images View gallery IT workers aren’t just facilitating business goals; they’re driving change at an
                        organizational level. CEOs are leaning on IT to deliver a competitive advantage as much as they do for a marketing strategy. It seems to me that this shift is directly related to “The Internet of Everything” movement, which refers
                        to the near future in which nearly every aspect of our lives will be connected to the Internet. Since our reliance on technology increases with each passing day, IT is steadily moving to the front end—not the back—of business.

                        <p>Many Digital Project fails because of the common reasons:
                            <ul>
                                <li> 1. Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely
                                    to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and
                                    business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success. </li>
                                <li>2. Lack of cross-functional expertise: Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process management
                                    skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.</li>
                                <li> 3. Limited digital strategy. Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically
                                    what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.</li>
                                <li> 4. Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your
                                    digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.</li>
                                <li> 5. Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,”
                                    or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure
                                    path to failure.</li>
                                <p>

                                    To succeed at software development you need to be flexible in your choice of software development method, to choose the right one for the job. There are several reasons why it is important to do so: Different technologies require different techniques
                                    also every individual is unique and every team is unique. Your external needs vary, your project and method categories are vary. Each method category appeals to a different mindset. For example, code and fix methods
                                    are attractive to maverick developers, often referred to as cowboys, that prefer to work alone with little guidance. Although great software can sometimes be created this way, the reality is that the approach doesn’t
                                    scale well to teams of people nor does it succeed very often. It is possible to easily adopt and support several methods within your organization if you choose to do so. To succeed you should: Adopt a small subset of
                                    the available methods, be prepared to tailor the process to each project team, define common goals, not common artifacts, be flexible and prioritize.

                                <p>GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation. What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected
                                    across Europe. GDPR’s impact on obtaining consent Under GDPR, methods digital marketers use to obtain consent will be held to a much higher standard. Changes include: Active opt-in – Consent will require a positive
                                    opt-in through clear affirmative action. Pre-ticked boxes, for example, will no longer be compliant Granular – Individuals should get as much detail as possible on what their data will be processed for. Best practice
                                    will be to let individuals withdraw consent for each distinct processing activity. Blanket consent will not be compliant Unbundling – Consent requests must be separated from terms and conditions Not a pre-condition
                                    of service – Consent should not be a precondition of signing up to a service unless necessary such as a newspaper subscription Named – It should be clear to the individual who will be processing their data including
                                    any third-parties</p>
